Hello, and welcome to my Encrypter & Decrypter Program!
This is a menu-based program which allows you to either:

  1) Encrypt an inputted text into a Caesar cypher, and select the number of places shifted.
  2) Decrypt an inputted Caesar cypher.

Upon completion, you can terminate the code using the exit option in the menu.

Enjoy!
